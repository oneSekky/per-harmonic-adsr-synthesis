Excited to share my Digital Signal Processing final project! 🎵

I developed a parametric audio synthesizer that solves a fundamental
limitation in pitch-shifting: traditional methods destroy temporal
envelopes (attack becomes sharp when pitched up, sluggish when
pitched down).

My solution uses per-harmonic ADSR envelope decomposition:
✓ FIR filter bank isolates individual harmonics
✓ Automated greedy optimization across 26 basis functions
✓ Achieved 10-12% reconstruction improvement on piano samples
✓ Enables pitch transposition without temporal distortion

### Resume Bullet Point:
```
• Developed parametric audio synthesizer achieving 10-12% reconstruction
  improvement through per-harmonic ADSR envelope optimization
• Implemented FIR filter bank with Kaiser windowing and automated basis
  function selection across 1,764 configurations
• Validated approach through rigorous experimental analysis across 14
  instrument samples (bass, piano, violin, percussion, voice)
```
